    <h1>More Than Just a Code: A Day in the Life of an IT Student</h1>
    <hr>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p class="highlight">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Honestly, if I had known earlier that IT would be this intense, I probably would
      have thought about it longer. Not saying I regret it, but it really hits different.
      Before, I thought IT was just about computers—typing code, staring at screens, and
      that’s it.
      <span class="important">
        But now, as an IT student, every day feels like a small battle with stress,
        sleepless nights, pressure, and endless deadlines.
      </span>
    </p>

    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      This blog is just me sharing what a normal day in my IT life really looks like.
      <span class="important">No sugarcoating—just a real story.</span>
    </p>

    <h2>Morning: Wake Up, Check the Phone, Panic Mode</h2>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Most of the time, my day starts with checking my phone. Messenger, group chats,
      Canvas, and even the time—just to see if I’m already late or if I still have a
      chance to make it.
      <span class="important">
        Most days, I already assume I’m late, and that’s when the panic really kicks in.
      </span>
    </p>

    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Every morning, I use my father’s motorcycle to go to school. The ride usually
      takes around 30 to 60 minutes. During the ride, my mind is already full of thoughts:
      unfinished tasks, upcoming deadlines, and whether I remembered to submit something
      or not.
    </p>

    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Sometimes the road is calm, sometimes traffic is bad, but either way, that travel
      time gives me space to think.
      <span class="important">
        By the time I arrive at school, I’m already a bit exhausted, but I remind myself
        that this is just another day I need to get through and learn from.
      </span>
    </p>

    <h2>Afternoon: Code, Errors, and a Bit of an Existential Crisis</h2>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      When coding subjects start, this is the part where I sometimes stop and think,
      “Is this really for me?” There are days when I understand the lesson easily,
      and there are days when one small mistake in the code can keep me stuck for hours.
      It’s frustrating and draining.
    </p>

    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Sometimes I wonder if I’m just not good enough, but later on, I realized that
      this is actually normal.
      <span class="important">Everyone gets errors—even the good ones.</span>
      The difference is they don’t quit right away.
    </p>

    <h2>Evening: Tired but Still Moving Forward</h2>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      At night, the exhaustion really hits. Sometimes I review lessons, sometimes I
      just stare at the screen and think about how I survived the day.
      <span class="important">
        But despite everything, there’s still a small sense of fulfillment.
      </span>
    </p>

    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      <span class="important">
        Even if the path was full of errors, at least I learned something.
      </span>
    </p>

    <h2>Conclusion / Reflection</h2>
    <p class="highlight">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      <span class="important">
        The truth is, IT is not for people who give up easily.
      </span>
      It’s not enough to just be good with computers—you need patience, resilience,
      and the courage to accept mistakes.
    </p>

    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      <span class="important">
        Rest when you’re tired, complain if you need to, but don’t quit.
      </span>
      One day, all these errors will be the reason you become stronger.
    </p>
